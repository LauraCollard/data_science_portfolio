# Supervised learning project: predicting poisonous mushrooms


In this project, we explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance by adjusting key parameters of different supervised learning models for classification. The data we work with is from the [UCI Mushroom Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom?ref=datanews.io).


**Toolkit**: Python, Scikit-learn, Decision tree, Support Vector Classifier
