# Supervised learning project: predicting poisonous mushrooms


In this project, we explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of different supervised learning models for classification. The data we work with is from the [UCI Mushroom Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom?ref=datanews.io).

*This project was completed as part of the Applied Machine Learning in Python course on Coursera (University of Michigan).*


**Toolkit**: Python, Scikit-learn, Decision tree, Support Vector Classifier
