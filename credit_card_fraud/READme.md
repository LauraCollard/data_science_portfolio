# Detecting credit card fraud


In this project, we train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of credit card fraud using data based on [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The original dataset contains 284,807 transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. Out of these transactions, 492 are fraudulent (0.17% of all transactions).


**Toolkit**: Python, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Dummy classifier, Logistic regression, GridSearchCV
