# Data Science portfolio

Here is a selection of projects I have recently completed. Feel free to have a look around! Alternatively, the portfolio is also available to view on my [website](https://lauracollard.github.io).

- [Detecting credit card fraud: improving performance with Deep Learning](https://github.com/LauraCollard/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/credit_card_fraud): comparing different models' performance at predicting instances of credit card fraud. The final model is a 5-layer neural network built with Keras that correctly flags 99.94% of transactions.

- [Deep Learning: predicting Iris species](https://github.com/LauraCollard/deep_learning_iris): using TensorFlow, we build and train a 3-layer neural network that predicts Iris species.

- [Predicting Boston housing prices](https://github.com/LauraCollard/boston_housing): using a machine learning model to predict house prices in the Boston metropolitan area. Identifying the optimal price for clients wishing to sell their home.

- [Finding donors for *CharityML*](https://github.com/LauraCollard/finding_donors_for_charity): in this project, we compare several machine learning algorithms in order to accurately model individuals' income and predict who is likely to become a donor.

- [Mushrooms: safe to eat or deadly?](https://github.com/LauraCollard/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/poisonous_mushrooms): predicting whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous using different machine learning models.

- [Exploratory analysis: Titanic dataset](https://github.com/LauraCollard/titanic_expl_analysis): using Seaborn visualisations, this project explores the passengers' details and reveals which factors helped some of them survive the shipwreck.


**Toolkit:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
