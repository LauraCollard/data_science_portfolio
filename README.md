# Data Science portfolio

Here is a selection of projects I have recently completed. Feel free to have a look around! Alternatively, the portfolio is also available to view on my [website](https://lauracollard.github.io).

- Machine Learning projects:

  - [Credit card fraud: improving detection with Deep Learning](https://github.com/LauraCollard/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/credit_card_fraud): comparing different models performance at predicting instances of card fraud. The final model is a 5-layer Neural Network built with Keras that correctly classifies 99.94% of transactions.

  - [Predicting Boston housing prices](https://github.com/LauraCollard/boston_housing): using a Machine Learning model to predict house prices in the Boston metropolitan area. Identifying the optimal price for clients wishing to sell their home.

  - [Finding donors for *CharityML*](https://github.com/LauraCollard/finding_donors_for_charity): in this project, we compare several Machine Mearning algorithms in order to accurately model individuals' income and predict who is likely to become a donor.

  - [Mushrooms: safe to eat or deadly?](https://github.com/LauraCollard/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/poisonous_mushrooms): predicting whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous using different Machine Mearning models.

  - [Exploratory analysis: Titanic dataset](https://github.com/LauraCollard/titanic_expl_analysis): using Seaborn visualisations, this project explores the passengers' details and reveals which factors helped some of them survive the shipwreck.


- Natural Language Processing projects:

  - [Detecting spam text messages](https://github.com/LauraCollard/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/nlp_spam_sms): predicting whether a text message is spam or legitimate with different models. The best performance is obtained with a Multinomial Naive Bayes model and a CountVectorizer approach.
  

**Toolkit:** Python, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
